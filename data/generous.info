Lightweight code comment parsing & API doc generation node module.

generous was written to add comprehensive, free-form document generation as a
seamless part of your build process.

Typically code comment parsers impose a strict structure onto your code which
may or may not fit (e.g. the difficulties of using JSDoc to document angular,
hence ngdocs creation). generous allows you to easily denote relationships
between any two items as well as determine your own tags to be parsed. In addition,
it allows you to use existing comment structures without too much overhead.
