 * @description
Lightweight code comment parsing & API doc generation node module.

generous was written to address the perceived restrictive / inaccessible
approach of other comment parsers, in that you are limited to using
specific tags to indicate the relationships and purpose of content.

Typically such parsers therefore impose a structure onto your code which
may or may not fit (e.g. the difficulties of using JSDoc to document angular,
hence ngdocs creation). generous allows you to easily denote relationships
between anything as well as determine your own tags to be parsed. In addition,
it allows you to use existing comment structures without too much overhead.
