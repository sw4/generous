 Out of the box generous supports a number of comment tags it can recognise and parse.
 Every generous comment should be placed within `/**/` comment blocks, and each tag to
 parse should appear on a new line, the first of which should be `@generous`, unless you
 have specified another denominator under the options parsed to the module to run with.
